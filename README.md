In my first mockup, you will see and image of the device (currently represented by a box with an X in the middle) on the left side of the screen, this is just to connect the user with the phsical device even through the app. On the top of the screen the date will be shown just so the user can be sure of the date, without having to check any other locations and in the final product the calander should be able to be clicked and expanded to see what the schedule for medication looks like. In the Right corner there are two icons, clicking the "?" give you information on how to find out more about a certent medication, or point you in the direction of a pharmasist, while the bell will give you a drop down of your 5-8 most resent alerts. In the middle of the screen, is you're helper, whenever you open the app they will give you motiviation/ encoragement and will alert you when a medican is running low or in out. In the bottom left corner you will see a list of medicine that is in you're device along side indicaters that show how much you have or how close you are to running out, as the bar droppes it will change colors from green, to yellow, to red. Finally, in the bottom right side of the screen you will see were you can input new medicine (The dimonds represent different stages of the process, first what medication needs to be added, secound is the amount that you need to take, third is the times you need to take them. In the final dimond you can click on it and ask you're helper some general question, if they can not answer the question they will direct you to the question mark in the top right corner for more indepth information.) 

What I Like:
I really like the helper that I added, something with some medication like SSRIs it can be hard to stay motivated to take them consistantly even if they are helping you and they are some have bad consiquences if just cut off with being wanned off of them. I think the helper could help keep people taking them, and make it so that there is some kind of interation involved when taking you're medication.

What is Missing:
You could say a direct voice from us or a doctor is missing, with the second mockup those videos can give you a window into a real person and not just an AI tool.

The second mockup is relitivly simplier, in the top left corner you will see the same square with an X in it, this will still show you an image of you're device, but if this image is clicked you should see a drop down that shows you a list of all you're medication with similar indicators that where shown in the first mockup to let you know how much of each medication you have left. To the right of the image you will see a search bar, this will allow you to search for your specific medication from that search you can add it to you're list if needed and put in the information for how much you are taking and what days it needs to be taken on, along with that you will also have an option to play a short informational video on what you're medicaion is for and some gernal DON'Ts for when you are taking the medication. Without that input the video player will show a short video welcomeing you to the device and how to use it and the app. On the Right side of the screen you will be shown what medication you are supposed to be taking that day along with the amont that should be taken. On the bottom of the page you will be a calander, this will work the same as the calander function from the first mockup. Finally in the bottom right corner you will see a bell, this will also work the same as in the first mockup, where it will show you the date and if the calander itself is clicked will show you, your medication scheduale for that month, the coming months, or the past months. 

What I Like:
I like the simpleicity in it, and I also like having a video player that would be able to give you infomation on you're specific medication if needed. The video player would also give the user the chance to see the faces behind the machine so they know it's not just a tool to keep track of when to take medicince, but it was created to help people and that real people but time and money into something because they care about there customers.

What is Missing:
Although it doesn't have to be an AI friend like in the first mockup I think intigrating some kind of tool that a user can have some kind of back and forth with could be good. Like maybe a small popup for an AI chat tool that could conncect you with live people could also fit into this idea.
