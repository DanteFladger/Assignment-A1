In my first mockup, you will see an image of the device (currently represented by a box with an X in the middle) on the left side of the screen, this is just to connect the user with the physical device even through the app. On the top of the screen, the date will be shown just so the user can be sure of the date, without having to check any other locations, and in the final product the calendar should be able to be clicked and expanded to see what the schedule for medication looks like. In the Right corner, there are two icons, clicking the "?" gives you information on how to find out more about a certain medication, or points you in the direction of a pharmacist, while the bell will give you a drop-down of your 5-8 most recent alerts. In the middle of the screen, is you're helper, whenever you open the app they will give you motivation/encouragement and will alert you when a medicine is running low or out. In the bottom left corner, you will see a list of medicines that are in your device alongside indicators that show how much you have or how close you are to running out, as the bar drops it will change colors from green to yellow, to red. Finally, in the bottom right side of the screen, you will see where you can input new medicine (The diamonds represent different stages of the process, first what medication needs to be added, second is the amount that you need to take, third is the times you need to take them. In the final diamond you can click on it and ask you're helper some general questions, if they can not answer the question they will direct you to the question mark in the top right corner for more in-depth information.) 

What I Like:
I like the helper that I added, something with some medications like SSRIs it can be hard to stay motivated to take them consistently even if they are helping you and they are some have bad consequences if just cut off with being wanned off. I think the helper could help keep people taking them, and make it so that some interaction is involved when taking your medication.

What is Missing:
You could say a direct voice from us or a doctor is missing, with the second mockup those videos can give you a window into a real person and not just an AI tool.

The second mockup is relatively simpler, in the top left corner you will see the same square with an X in it, this will still show you an image of your device, but if this image is clicked you should see a drop-down that shows you a list of all you're medication with similar indicators that where shown in the first mockup to let you know how much of each medication you have left. To the right of the image, you will see a search bar, this will allow you to search for your specific medication from that search you can add it to you're list if needed and put in the information for how much you are taking and what days it needs to be taken on, along with that you will also have the option to play a short informational video on what you're medication is for and some general DON'Ts for when you are taking the medication. Without that input, the video player will show a short video welcoming you to the device and how to use it and the app. On the Right side of the screen, you will be shown what medication you are supposed to be taking that day along with the amount that should be taken. On the bottom of the page, you will see a calendar, this will work the same as the calendar function from the first mockup. Finally, in the bottom right corner, you will see a bell, this will also work the same as in the first mockup, where it will show you the date and if the calendar itself is clicked will show you, your medication schedule for that month, the coming months, or the past months. 

What I Like:
I like the simplicity of it, and I also like having a video player that would be able to give you information on you're specific medication if needed. The video player would also give the user the chance to see the faces behind the machine so they know it's not just a tool to keep track of when to take medicine, but it was created to help people and that real people but time and money into something because they care about there customers.

What is Missing:
Although it doesn't have to be an AI friend like in the first mockup I think integrating some kind of tool that a user can have some kind of back and forth with could be good. Like maybe a small popup for an AI chat tool that could connect you with live people could also fit into this idea.
